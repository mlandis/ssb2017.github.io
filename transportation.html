    <h3>By Air</h3>
	<h4><a href="http://www.flybtr.com">Baton Rouge Metro Airport (BTR)</a></h4>
	<p>The newly-renovated Baton Rouge Metropolitan Airport (BTR) is located 7.8 miles from the meeting site in Downtown Baton Rouge and is served by American Airlines, Delta and United. Information on ground transportation to and from BTR can be found <a href="http://www.flybtr.com/CaseStudies/CaseStudies.asp">here.</a></p>
	<p><a href="https://www.uber.com/">Uber</a> service between the Baton Rouge Metro Airport and SSB conference hotels is available for passengers with scheduled pickups/dropoffs, and usually runs in the range of $12-$15.</p>
	<p>Taxi fare from the Baton Rouge Metro Airport to conference hotels downtown is <a href="https://www.taxifarefinder.com/main.php?city=Baton-Rouge-LA&from=9430+Jackie+Cochran+Drive%2C+Baton+Rouge%2C+LA+70807%2C+United+States&to=Hilton+Baton+Rouge+Capitol+Center%2C+Lafayette+Street%2C+Baton+Rouge%2C+LA%2C+United+States&fromCoord=30.5343014,-91.15730919999999&toCoord=30.4487599,-91.18984319999998">approximately $21.93 in light traffic, including 15% gratuity.</a></p>

It is served by all major airlines, including Frontier, Southwest and Spirit Airlines and may offer lower fares. There is no direct transit from MSY to Downtown Baton Rouge, however, so renting a car may be necessary.</p>
